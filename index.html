          <br />

          Yourre more than just a sister to me—your're my biggest support, my
          strength, and my safe place. Your love, your care, your guidance, and
          everything your've done for me means more than I could ever say.

          <br />
          Thank you for always being there, guiding me like a second mother. I
          truly don't know what I'd do without you.
          <br />

          Wishing you all the happiness and love you give so selflessly to
          others. You deserve the world.
          <br />
          Love you always. 🎂💖
